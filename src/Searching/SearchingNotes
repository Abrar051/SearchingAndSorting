Searching 2 types
1 linear searching
2 binary searching

Linear searching time complexity
(1+2+3+4+......+n)/n

Binary searching precondition
The array or linked list must be arranged in ascending or descending order


Steps for binary searching
1 : At first in binary search middle element is iterate
    Middle = (1st + last) /2
2 : if item is less than middle cut the other part of middle and search on the left side of middle
3 : if greater than cut left side and search in right side


Algorithm for merging sort


Heap Sort is a popular and efficient sorting algorithm in computer programming.
Learning how to write the heap sort algorithm requires knowledge of two types of data structures - arrays and trees.
The initial set of numbers that we want to sort is stored in an array e.g.
[10, 3, 76, 34, 23, 32] and after sorting, we get a sorted array [3,10,23,32,34,76]
Heap sort works by visualizing the elements of the array as a special kind of complete binary tree called a heap.
