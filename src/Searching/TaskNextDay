Next day do a task about
1 : write a code to sort a list using selection sort algorithm
2 : write a code to sort a list using insertion sort algorithm
3 : write a code to sort a list using heap sort algorithm
4 : write a code to sort a list using merge sort algorithm
5 : write a code to sort a list using quick sort algorithm
6 : store 16 integers in an array in ascending order use binary search -- done
7 : write a program selection , insertion ,merge , heap and quick sort . compare timing of every type sort with same type data
done selection sort
all type sorting
